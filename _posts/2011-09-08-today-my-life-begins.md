I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me  
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins  
A whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking  
I know i can make it, today my life begins

We only have one life to live  
So you better make the best of it

**Bruno Mars - Today My Life Begins**
